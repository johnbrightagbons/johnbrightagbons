Hi there! I'm John Bright Agbons, a Software Development student at Brigham Young University – Idaho, with a strong passion for building meaningful digital tools. I started my professional journey as an teacher and ICT specialist, and I’m now leveraging that experience to create software solutions that solve real-world problems. My core interests lie in web development, data analysis, eduTech and personal finance applications that empower users and communities.
I'm a lifelong learner, committed to growth, collaboration, and purpose-driven coding. I love building apps that are not just functional, but also accessible and helpful for everyone—from students and professionals to small businesses and families.
